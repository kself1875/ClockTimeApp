# ClockTimeApp
I created an app for the utilization of international and domestic clients ... The logic I implemented created two clocks that displayed simultaneously, also allowing for user input...

I am very humble.. But I would say I excelled on the attention to detail in relation to the flowchart. Carefully implementing each step in the flowchart enabled me to have success...

Overall, my code needs to be enhanced. I am more comfortable with the thoeretical aspects of my code... The application aspects, however, really need to be improved...

Being a first time user of C++, I believe the most challenging part was to utilize the proper syntax when implementing the dual clock diplay in different formats... I understood the theory, but could not apply it.. I investigted outside sources, and I also reached out to the tutoring services my institution provided for success...

The application aspects were difficult.. Especially knowing when and how to assign my variables..

I felt it was important to utilize comments... This would make my code easier to understand and to target problem areas.. Also, the comments worked in tandem for me when follwoing the outlines in the flowchart... They reminded me, what I needed to work on next for the project...
