# ClockTimeApp

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created an app for the utilization of international and domestic clients ... The logic I implemented created two clocks that displayed simultaneously, also allowing for user input...

What did you do particularly well?
I am very humble.. But I would say I excelled on the attention to detail in relation to the flowchart. Carefully implementing each step in the flowchart enabled me to have success...

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Overall, my code needs to be enhanced. I am more comfortable with the thoeretical aspects of my code... The application aspects, however, really need to be improvved...

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Being a first time user with C++, I believe the most challenging part was implementing the dual clock diplay in different formats... I understtod the theory, but could not apply it.. I investigted outside sources, and I also reached out to the tutoring services my institution provided for success...

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The application aspects.. Especially knowing when and how to assign my variables..

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I felt it was important to utilize comments... This would make my code easier to understand and to target problem areas.. Also, the comments worked in tandem for me when follwoing the outlines in the flowchart... They reminded me, what I needed to work on next for the project...
